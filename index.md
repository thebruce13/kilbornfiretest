The Kilbourn Fire Department; formed in 1891 and is a completely unpaid volunteer fire department, proudly protects 7,600 people living in an area of 210 square miles. We operate out of one station that protects a primarily rural area. Our department is a public department whose members are on a volunteer status. Our membership includes 36 active and 56 retired members. As a popular tourist area, the local population frequently swells to over 100,000 in the summer months.
